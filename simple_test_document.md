This is a small test document for the LearningHub application.

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

## Types of Machine Learning

1. **Supervised Learning**
   - Uses labeled data
   - Examples: classification, regression

2. **Unsupervised Learning**
   - Uses unlabeled data
   - Examples: clustering, association

3. **Reinforcement Learning**
   - Learns through interaction
   - Examples: game playing, robotics

## Common Applications

- Email spam detection
- Product recommendations
- Medical diagnosis
- Financial fraud detection
- Image recognition

This document contains basic information about machine learning that can be used to test the document processing and chat functionality of the LearningHub application.
