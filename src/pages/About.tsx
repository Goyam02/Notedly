                Notedly began with a simple observation: despite all the technological advancements in recent years, the way we study hasn't fundamentally changed. Students still struggle with information overload, inefficient note-taking, and difficulty finding exactly what they need when they need it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our founder, Alex, experienced this firsthand while pursuing his graduate studies. Overwhelmed by reading materials and lecture notes, he found himself wishing for a smart study assistant that could help him navigate and extract insights from his growing collection of notes and textbooks.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2023, he assembled a team of AI researchers, educators, and product designers to create what would become Notedly: a platform that uses artificial intelligence to transform static study materials into interactive learning experiences.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, Notedly is helping thousands of students, professionals, and lifelong learners study more effectively by making their notes work harder for them. And we're just getting started.
